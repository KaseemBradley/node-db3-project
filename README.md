## Task 2: Project Minimum Viable Product

### Database

Open `data/schemes.db3` using a graphical tool like SQLite Studio and study the data inside the `schemes` and `steps` tables. The data can be reset at any time by executing `npm run seed`.

### API

Open `api/schemes/scheme-router.js` and study the specification for each endpoint. You do not need to make any changes to this file.

- `[GET] /api/schemes`
- `[GET] /api/schemes/:scheme_id`
- `[GET] /api/schemes/:scheme_id/steps`
- `[POST] /api/schemes`
- `[POST] /api/schemes/:scheme_id/steps`

### Middleware Functions

Write middleware functions in `api/schemes/scheme-middleware.js` following the instructions inside that file:

- [ ] `checkSchemeId`
- [ ] `validateScheme`
- [ ] `validateStep`

### Database Functions

Write db access functions in `api/schemes/scheme-model.js` following the instructions inside that file:

- [ ] `find`
- [ ] `findById`
- [ ] `findSteps`
- [ ] `add`
- [ ] `addStep`

#### Schemes Schema

| field       | data type        | metadata                                      |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| scheme_id   | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by db |
| scheme_name | string           | required, unique                              |

#### Steps Schema

| field        | data type        | metadata                                           |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| step_id      | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by db      |
| scheme_id    | unsigned integer | foreign key referencing scheme.scheme_id, required |
| step_number  | unsigned integer | required                                           |
| instructions | string           | required                                           |

### Notes

- Run tests locally executing `npm test`.
- You are welcome to create additional modules but do not move or rename existing files or folders.
- Do not change your `package.json` file except to install additional libraries or add additional scripts.
- In your solution it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work.
- Perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
